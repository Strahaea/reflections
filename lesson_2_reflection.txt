Q: What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

A: Repositories need to be initilialized so that git 
treats them as a repository and can begin to take in commits on those
files. If you did not initilialize git would not know to be involved
with those files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area allows a user to think about what
they are doing before they made a commit and also allows
them to add what files they believe are necessary for that commit.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

A: Using the staging area you can compare with the previous commit version using diff and ensure that you are only making one logical change per commit.
